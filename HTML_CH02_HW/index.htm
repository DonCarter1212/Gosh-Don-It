        <p> Pictured above is Blazblue: Cross Tag Battle (Commonly referred to
            as BBTAG), a crossover fighting game featuring characters from the
            Blazblue series (Ragna and Jin, Bottom), Under Night In-Birth series
            (Hyde and Linne, Left), Persona 4 Arena (Yu and Yosuke, Right), and
            popular web series RWBY (Ruby and Weiss, Top). I'll save the rant
            about the awesome concept of a crossover for a later date; this
            isn't meant to be a blog.

        <p> I am an avid gamer with an affinity for competitive games,
            especially fighters. Currently, I'm playing an anime fighter
            (most easily identified by their use of sprites rather than
            three-dimensional models) known as Blazblue: Cross Tag Battle
            and in contemplation of whether to fully go into the subgenre
            with Blazblue: Central Fiction or Under Night In-Birth Exe:
            Late [cl-r] (commonly referred to as BBCF and UNICLR
            respectively). I will say yes, these names are strange and
            even confusing, especially UNICLR, which sounds like a rom hack.
        </p>
        <p>I must also comment that fighting game terminology is weird. Out
            of all the terms I read so far, my personal favorite is "meaty",
            an adjective to describe an attack that hits someone the moment
            they stand up. There's a term for such an occurrence because
            most fighters give you invulnerability as you get back on your
            feet. An attack is meaty when it hits you the moment that
            invulnerability wears off.
