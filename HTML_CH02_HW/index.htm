        <p> Pictured above is Blazblue: Cross Tag Battle, a fighting game
            featuring characters from the Blazblue series (Ragna and Jin,
            Bottom), Under Night In-Birth series (Hyde and Linne, Left),
            Persona 4 Arena (Yu and Yosuke, Right), and popular web series
            RWBY (Ruby and Weiss, Top). I'll save the rant about the awesome
            concept of a crossover for a later date; this isn't meant to be
            a blog.

        <p> I am an avid gamer with an affinity for competitive games,
            especially fighters. Currently, I'm playing an anime fighter
            (most easily identified by their use of sprites rather than
            three-dimensional models) known as Blazblue: Cross Tag Battle
            and in contemplation of whether to fully go into the subgenre
            with Blazblue: Central Fiction or Under Night In-Birth Exe:
            Late [cl-r] (commonly referred to as BBCF and UNICLR
            respectively). I will say yes, these names are confusing and
            over the top, especially UNICLR, which sounds like a rom hack.
