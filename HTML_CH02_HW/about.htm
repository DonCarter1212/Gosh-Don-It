        <p> As the old stereotype goes, I am a gamer who still lives with his mother,
            thankfully not in the basement; there are spiders down there!
        </p>
        <p> My immediate family includes my mother, a scientist known as Kympocalypse,
            my stepfather, a renown comedian known as Mayhem, and my brother, an
            eccentric artist who goes by Phoenix.
